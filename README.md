# what-is-the-weather

## Description
I wanted to build a website that could take information from a thrid party API adn tell me something. In this case the weather. This project allows me to look up the weather anywhere that Open Weather Maps' API allows me to go. I learned how to connect APIs to javascript. I also was bale to work more on my HTML, JQuery, CSS,a nd Bootstrap skills.
